##This was the experiment I tried while learning about Kalman Filters. Here, the points (object detected) from a noisy sensor measurement,
##needs to be filtered out. And as we have the groundtruth points it is easy to see if it works. Below figure shows the output before and after
##applying the Kalman Filter.
